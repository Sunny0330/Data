We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there. After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer. We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive. If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd.","0","0","0"

We were greeted promptly and brought to our table.  The chips were fresh and warm.  The salsa was a little blander than we care for.  Service seemed slow, but in all fairness it was Saturday evening.  I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas which had pieces of lobster sautÃ©ed with onion and tomato wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  It was average.  My husband had the Burrito Especial with a chicken burrito and a beef tip burrito.  Hubby said it was above average.  The rice had a nice flavor with an aftertaste of tomato and cilantro.  We were disappointed with the lack of complex flavor profiles that we have become accustomed to while living in the Southwest.

It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either, I ordered a piÃ±a colada and the waiter spill it over me without replacing it not good at all, the place tries so hard to be unique and as Mexican as can be but it is just a caricature and a stereotype of anything Mexican honestly I was waiting for the three amigos to come out of the bathroom or something I despise decoration like this  and it affected the overall rating. Second time there food was not as good I ordered a dish that included carnitas in it but they were missing I told my waiter he apologized brought them in told me he was sorry but he charged me for them anyways even though they were supposed to be included.

Mexican food can too easily be greasy, but this was not. The menu is nothing startling, but the classic mexican dishes were all on the mark. And there was enough left over for a second meal tomorrow.Prices were very reasonable - our total bill, including tips, was less than $25.  Definitely planning another visit.","3","0","2"

I didn't take notes - too busy enjoying the company - but I'm pretty sure I got a burrito and it was delicious.

Nibble some fresh chips and salsa while you ponder your meal options. The salsa is fresh with tomatoes, cilantro and spice. In case that isn't enough heat for you ask for the special sauce from the kitchen for extra kick and spice.I ordered the chili rellenos hoping not to be disappointed - this gal spent some time in Arizona and loves her Mexican food. These didn't disappoint. Yum. Served with rice and beans with a drizzle of red sauce.Good enough to want to return and sample through the menu -- several other items caught my eye - fish tacos, nightly specials, burritos with tomatillo sauce!!!

You get your chips and salsa as you sit down as usual while they take orders for drinks.  They got horchata here now, which is a + in my book, if you haven't tried it yet, i totally recommend to.  The food came out rather fast and speedy on extremely hot plates.  The salsa and hot sauces there are bombbbbb. Ask them for homemade style hot sauces they make in the kitchen, it's different everytime you go in.  Some will leave you sweating and some will leave a sweet or an extra tomato flavor in your mouth.The food i'd definitely rate 7.5/10. as i'm a hardcore mexican food lover.  It's nothing you find in texas or california, but quite damn close.  I always find myself coming back to this fun filled, warm, family owned place and always leave feeling satisfied.  for taqueria style tacos, try the tacos el pastor!","0","0","1"

Seated immediately, the waiter came to the table immediately, and the food came almost immediately after we'd ordered.

I got a carnitas dinner platter and I could only finish half since I filled up on chips and salsa and guacamole. It was so good! The only disappointing part was the dessert. We ordered flan, and when it arrived it was covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce which I am not a fan of. The consistency was nubbly. Should've went with the churros.","1","0","1"

It was a burrito  with eggs, chorizo and cheese.  It was probably one of the most tasteless burritos I've ever had. It was covered in what appeared to be some sort of franks red hot sauce, and no im not mistaking it for enchilada sauce. The side of my plate was a pile of tomatoes shredded cheese and a piece of lettuce, a whole piece not shredded. Not happy with my lunch at all. The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me. I like quick service, but also don't mind waiting a few minutes for some really good food. Overall the place was cute, people were friendly but food was less than OK.

Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much.     As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners.

I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.

The place looked open, but empty -- we pulled into the drive through, asked if they were still open, and received a very enthusiastic ""For three more minutes!""  I felt bad about it, but the cashier was nice, and the fellow who handed us our burgers jokingly said that they were made with love.  It seems odd to say it, but he sounded genuinely sincere.  Ordered two cheeseburgers with extra everything, a double-double, and two fries.  Fries were piping hot / crispy, single burgers were heavily laden with at least 2.5 times the normal veggies -- unusually large for 'extra everything.'  I wouldn't normally leave a review for an In N Out, but everyone we spoke to was very nice, and they served us so close to closing.  Thank you!","2","0","0"

I had read the reviews of my Yelp friends and likes the sound of the Rafael pizza which was on their special of the day and it sounded good.  When I talked to the young man at the podium and told him I wanted to place a To Go order, I told him about the pizza and the reviews.  He told me he'd check and a short time later, he came back and told me they could make it but they didn't have the caramelized onions for it.  I told him to order it anyway.In just a few short minutes, the pizza was brought to me as I waited in their small waiting area.  I brought it home and it was very good.  It was also the perfect size for two people.My preference is still for thick crust, Sicilian style pizza, but I can see that Settebello will be on my rotation list.  And, I want to try some of the others as well.Good service and good pizza!","2","0","1"

Maybe it just hit me because it was new and I didn't expect a pizza joint to be so nicely decorated. Would recommend for a nice low-key date night with a movie theater just steps away. Their pizzas  come in one size, which I approximate around 10-12 inches round. Perfect for sharing between two people or feeding a very hungry individual. The Pizza Napoletana dough is softer than your average pizza and is meant to be eaten with a knife and fork. The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven and I would liken it to a thicker version of Indian naan bread. Wonderful texture, in my opinion. Ordered the Vico pizza  with sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, and basil. The sausage was nicely seasoned and all the ingredients complemented each other well.I made sure to save room for dessert which I think were called Bombolinis.

No available seating outside but open tables inside so we opted for those. Ordered a round of cocktails -- I got the brandy old fashioned and made it sour, and my friends got the jalapeÃ±o mule. We all loved our drinks! I tried the jalapeÃ±o mule and it had a little kick to it but was very good. For food, we ordered salads. My friends got the sweet corn caesar and I got Amy's salad. We added chicken to them to make the meal more substantial. They forgot the goat cheese on the Amy's salad, which would have made it even more delicious than it already was! Only complaint about the Amy's salad was that it was really heavy on the dressing. Like the spinach leaves were all thoroughly coated. Next time I'll ask for dressing on the side. My friends loved the Caesar salads -- I'll have to try that one sometime as well!Overall a nice first experience at Cooper's Tavern -- we will be returning!","1","0","1"

I gave it one stars because it did have flavor but the crust is chewy and it reminded me of pita bread Not good. You can't pick a slice up with your hands. If you like Napoletana pizza this might be ok although I have never been to Naples.  I haven't been to the Henderson location but I didn't think it will be much better.  Everyone has an opinion and we all have our own taste.  The reviews that were 5 stars I can't for the life of me understand why unless they don't know great pizza.

There were multiple waiters but refills were neglected. 4. The pizza just wasn't that great. Project pie, Grimaldis, biaggios, and other pizza places in Vegas are a lot better. 5. The waiter had a difficult time splitting the checks. 6. We both got sick from what we ate and had stomach issues all night. TMIWe will not be going back.

As this location on Sahara is closer to home, I gave it a try! Gotta say - the Green Valley location makes better pizza! The crust was much doughier at the Sahara location while GV's is crispy and light. My Emilia pizza had corn on it at GV and did not have ANY corn on it at Sahara (my favorite ingredient in that pizza!!!) Ambience and decor is nicer at this Sahara location with a more industrial chic look. GV's location is a little more of an italian restaurant feel. I love the patio at GV - wish Sahara's location had one too!Overall, I think the food is still good but it's worth the drive down to Henderson to their other location.

This location is quite larger than its Henderson counterpart, and the furniture and tables (including lighting and bar) are equal parts rustic and gorgeous.The only drawback to this location (as opposed to one in Henderson) is that they don't serve gelato.

Madison is a great beer city - I was really pleasantly surprised - and Cooper's Tavern represents. They've got a fantastic on tap menu as well as a great bottled selection, so there was definitely something for everyone.I ordered the pork belly mac n cheese. Oh my god the deliciousness. In fact, I texted my compatriot Chef Lucy to ooh and goo over the taste. The sweetness of the pork belly was perfectly complimented by the sharp white Wisconsin cheddar and I loved it.My dinner companions also enjoyed their meals (though I can't recall for the life of me what they ordered). It was pouring outside so we elected to stay in the warm cozy restaurant for dessert and shared the Guinness chocolate cake - another solid choice. The crowd was mixed but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and I'll for sure go back if I find myself in Madison again.","2","0","2"

They have an amazing beer list, which features a wide range of styles, regions and tastes.  The server was attentive and responsive.  The item I ordered was a Cobb salad featuring corned beef, which turned out to be little more than an accent with about six very small cubes each measuring a quarter inch in diameter.  I guess I wrongly assumed that when you include a specific meat in the name of an entree salad, that it would have ""star billing"".   One of the other diners ordered a reuben sandwich and cup of reuben soup, each of which required no less than three beers to quash the residual salty taste.  I will probably take a chance at lunch, but if that is as unsatisfactory an experience, I will have no problem finding other places to patronize in downtown Madison.","0","0","0"

It's a short 5 minute walk from my apartment so I've been here a good number of times already. I love the beer list - with my favorite being the Monk's sour beer (not the full name of the beer but my memory is terrible - sorry!). The food has been a bit hit or miss for me and I do sometimes wish there were some more options. It's more of a comfort food menu (e.g. grilled cheese, reuben, mac & cheese, etc.) but sadly without the option of cheese curds! The upstairs is great and if it is open - I would definitely recommend going up there. I also love that this is a go-to place for any soccer games including the world cup, English premier league, & Spanish premier league! It's always great to connect & cheer on with other fans :).

They always have soccer games playing, and there  are always other soccer fans around. On Saturday mornings for premiere league soccer, sometimes they open the upstairs area which is taken over by hardcore soccer fans. It's a lot of fun because you can watch soccer games on a big projector screen and hear singing/chanting/cheering from all the soccer fans. It does get pretty loud and crowded and is hard to get a table sometimes, but it's a great place to go if you enjoy soccer. The downstairs area is the main restaurant/bar and has a nice atmosphere. They have lots of great beers on tap, and the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. The food here is really good. They have a good variety of options on the menu.

The crispy pancetta on the top was a nice touch; however the toast points were lacking in flavor and texture, and possibly freshness. I would have appreciated it more if it were served with fresh, toasted (possibly in their Italian oven?!) bread rubbed with garlic or olive oil.The pizza was dynamite and could not be improved upon. I had a margherita, and my husband had a Diavolo. My son ordered a smaller cheese children's pizza - nice to have a kid option.Service was good. Decorated nicely.

It came with a pizza size bread type thing as well which was a little burnt. The mozzarella was delish and it went well with everything. I ordered the Bianca. I wasn't too impressed with it and since it was such a thin crust it got soggy pretty quickly. My husband ordered the Capricciosa. We weren't blown away by that either. Overall service wasn't the quickest and most attentive (waited for more napkins for a good 10 minutes or so) but the credit card machine was back in working order.

Gluten-free pizzas in other restaurants usually taste like really bad microwaved pizzas, but Settebello's recipe was totally different. Their gluten free pizza had like a naan bread base (which is probably just Napoli-style; I have never had it before, though, and that's the closest comparison I can draw!) and fresh ingredients piled on top of it. They're definitely not American pizzas; they have a very authentic Italian taste (especially the sauce). The hostess said pretty much anything on the menu can be made gluten free for just $4 extra, which was incredibly accommodating. My friend and I went at around 5PM on a Sunday, and it wasn't very crowded and service was incredibly quick (the pizzas came around 10 minutes after we ordered). The ambiance was really nice, too; it's very tastefully decorated and would probably make a great date night.","1","0","0"

This was our first visit to this location and my rating is probably closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I didn't think our experience was worth 4 stars. We were seated quickly and ordered the meatballs and capricciosa pizza. The meatballs were just ok, a little bland without the sauce, but the bread that accompanied it was good. In theory I liked all of the ingredients in the pizza - artichoke, prosciutto, olives, mushrooms, mozzarella, basil. What's not to like? But together, it didn't really work. I think if they used black olives instead of kalamata and chopped the artichoke hearts a bit smaller (instead of huge chunks), and added more mushrooms and prosciutto, it would've been 10 times better. I do like the thin crust and cooking it in a wood fired oven gives it a rustic flavor.Service was decent, not great, not terrible. We probably won't be going back anytime soon though :/","1","0","0"

However my soup which I ordered off the GF menu came out with a huge slice of sourdough laying on the soup spoon.

The coleslaw was subaverage and boring. Brussels sprouts salad was a surprise standout, with real bacon bits, a lightly applied but heavy cream sauce, and excellent blue cheese. The sprouts were served cold but perfectly cooked. Croutons were inexplicably bland--they were little more than over toasted bread with no seasoning. But the salad itself was good. Poutine is decent; it's all well executed local ingredients but tastes nothing like the rendition I had in Montreal. Not sure where it's off, perhaps the gravy. It's still decadent and tasty, if not authentic.During peak hours they cram people in a bit too closely for my taste. You're practically on top of your neighbor here. In off hours this is a comfortable place to eat and have a drink, and the bar stools are surprisingly comfortable as well.","1","0","0"

They give you practically an entree mixed greens salad along with the sandwich, so it was very filling, and tasty. My friends enjoyed their burgers.What I was especially impressed by, however, were the appetizers. We got frites, my favorite, and a pretzel/beer cheese app. Both were great. We also had great service and found it to be a nice atmosphere. I could see returning for some beer one night!","2","0","1"

I ordered the reuben sandwich with Belgian frites on the side and magner's apple cider on tap.  The reuben is as good as they say. The flavors of corned beef, swiss, sauerkraut, and dressing blend to perfectly proportioned perfection. It's mellow, smokey, heaven on toasted rye bread. Here's the clincher: the sauerkraut is marinated in scotch. That's what sets the flavors over the top. I don't think I'll order the Magner's again. Just not a fan.On ambiance: it's long, narrow, warmly lit with candles. Everyone is seated close together.

They even confirmed right before the visit. When I arrived, I was told a different stylist would be taking me but no one could tell me why. I wish I had not spent 10 minutes on the phone discussing my hair and what I needed so they could find me the 'perfect person' -since they gave me someone random anyway. Linda was very nice, but the haircut was uneven and the color was very streaky.  All Aveda salons try to push their products, but this was the worst. (They put together 4 or 5 ""suggested"" products in a basket and bring it to the station. Linda didn't push the products but the cashiers were relentless. They also cheaped out the validating so I had to pay half my parking. Either validate or don't, that's my opinion anyway. I won't be back. Maybe I am just cranky because my hair came out so poorly.","7","4","2"

For the last 8 months I've been seeing Dana.  I love coming in to see Dana - she's friendly, open, and always does an awesome job with my hair! I trust her judgement completely on what she thinks will/won't work with my hair. If rating my service from Dana alone, I'd give 5 stars Unfortunately my last provider, who I saw for nearly a year was horrible at cutting my hair and after our year-long relationship I finally opened up to her about trying to cut my hair a little differently and she pretty much popped. It's not that she was doing a bad job, but what she was doing wasn't working for me and I dealt with it for many many months. After her reaction, I spoke to a manager and was ready to take my services elsewhere when she proposed I meet with Dana. Things have been great since then!Other than that, the service is good. Little pricey.","0","0","0"

I am a real cheap-skate and I hate putting down money for non-essentials like hair cuts. HOWEVER, I have learned the hard way that cheap hair cuts actually end up costing you more than a good one. Not only do you look ridiculous, but you end up having a shorter amount of time in between cuts because of split ends, uneveness, etc. It's really not worth it. I can go between 8 to 10 weeks between haircuts at Mood Swings because they are nicely done and wear and grow out well. I love their hand and head massages as well as the make-up touch-up!The only reason I am not giving Mood Swings a 5-star review is the fact that they have nice but super fake service. There's a subtle difference between being polite and attentive and being on a reality TV show. I know that this is a minor quibble, but I thought that it warranted a mention.","0","0","0"

Also, I just personally don't like hand massages and would prefer something like an eyebrow trim as a bonus during my cut.Not much to complain about. I'll definitely go back to Brody!","2","0","0"

I called the salon twice to talk to a manager about my experience, and could not get someone to return my calls.  Disappointing.  Anyhow, after a few months, I finally had to chop off about 5 inches of my hair, because the breakage was so bad.   I don't fault the stylist, per se, but I think this procedure can be too harsh for fine hair, and I was not happy that two calls to the salon manager were unreturned, even afer I left my name, number, and reason for the call.","2","0","0"

My mom and Aunt love the downtown Henderson casinos so we all went here one night for dinner.  My Aunt and I both started with a cup of cream corn soup, and from the first taste of soup we knew this was going to be an excellent dining experience.  My Aunt got the T-Bone which was very tender and cooked to perfection.  My Mom had the coconut shrimp special that she noted as fresh and light.  I had the Country Fired Steak and French fries.  The French fries were awesome!  Some of the best fries I have ever had.  The service was also top notch.  Constantly refilling drinks and asking if we needed anything.  The price is also very reasonable.  I used to come here for a steak and eggs breakfast when I lived in Henderson and remembered always having a good experience.","0","1","0"

First the hostess asked how many, we told her 8, she said she would be back, she walked to the back then came back up front ensuring not to make eye contact with anyone. She checked someone out, then walked to the cage. Next another girl walked up asked how many, she said she would be back, she too went to the back and never to return,  but stood in the back of the restaurant to discuss the situation with ALL of her fellow employees. Finally a young gentleman came up and informed us they could not seat us together and we would have to sit half in a booth and the others in a table near by, mind you there were only 2 customers in the ENTIRE restaurant. The 3 standalone tables in the middle were all empty. Very disappointed in the customer service we received. We will not be returning again.","0","2","0"

I had to cross the street and I arrived there at 3:04 pm and I have not eaten all day.

The margarita pizza was a bit lacking in flavor, we'd rate it 3* but the pepperoni pizza was great at 4 stars. The NY pizza crust was excellent, along with good pizza sauce. The pepperoni was very good quality, not your usual greasy kind like at the corporate chain pizzas like Domino's, or Costco. the salad was good, fresh and we got the balsamic dressing and that was 5*.The two guys who were working, were very friendly and courteous-if only this was the norm and not extra ordinary.....it's a real joy to interact with people who love their jobs, it makes it a great experience, when it's food, it really adds to the enjoyment and you want to come back.It sucks when the people are good but the food is not, or vice versa.

The outside seating is always full of taxi drivers and Asian international students. It's impossible to walk into this Starbucks without wading through a thick cloud of cigarette smoke.

I had probably gone through about 4 different hairstylists before coming in because I could never get the same consistent quality in a haircut. Needless to say, the first time I stepped foot into the barbershop was the last time I stepped into a new one. If you're looking for a barbershop in the Scottsdale area, come to Shaving Grace.

He was finished, saw something he didn't like and went back and fixed it until it was perfect. I always ask for advice from these guys about hair styles and what products to use and they're always there to help. It's just a nice place to shoot the crap with some other nice dudes and get a solid hair cut for only $20. They're also very appreciative of any tip you give them.

Here goes:I show up for my haircut late while Boris talks shit to me and continues to eat his bacon and eggs out of a stirofoam box. My fault I am 5 minutes late BUT I was happy to let him stuff his face before he cut my brillo patch. After all, he works really hard cutting hair all day long. Often I wonder how he cuts his own hair but oddly enough the poor bastard doesn't have any. You bald dick, you. Getting to the point Shaving Grace is a great place to go. They always have a story that will make you laugh and they usually don't screw up on the whole hair cutting part either. But, let's be honest Boris - you got nothing on Eddie when it comes to cutting my Jew fro.","2","1","1"

Be aware of the barber Boris.. He's like that Axe commercial.. get your haircut by him, and the ladies will be all over you ;) lolThe shop is great, the Barbers are all gifted with the art of cutting, so what are you waiting for?

One of the people I went with is gluten-free (I know, **groan** haha just kidding), and our server brought out a piece of gluten free, flourless chocolate cake on the house.

Playing for both teams, and perhaps even bridging some gaps, there is plenty of eye candy and flirt-worthy boys for everyone.

The salad was a healthy prelude to all the fantastic food to come!  The penne vodka was the best i've ever had - the pasta was pleasantly al dente and the vodka sauce has a nice mix of flavors (slightly tangy, slightly sweet, slightly peppery).

I added chicken; that should have been grilled and seasoned, but was no doubt boiled with no flavor whatsoever. I did not even eat it for the extra 3 bucks.  If you bring bread to the table, bring butter, but not butter that is so hard you can't even get it on the bread. Pasta Brioni is saved by the ambiance.","0","1","0"

Wedge had wilted lettuce, tasteless tomato and the blue cheese had zero flavor. Then the  vealChop. Served with frozen spinach, tasteless mushrooms drenched in butter and the chop itself was bland and blah. The ciopini was blah. Overall not good at all. Too bad, used to be great. what came first, no business or crap ingredients and no chef? Surprised it's still in business.","1","0","0"

Food was spectacular.  I had penne pasta from the special menu, with some kind of vodka sauce, peas, ham, cheese - it sounds boring but it was awesome.  My partner had veal marsala - again awesome.  We will be back - it is pricey but worth it","1","0","2"

The food has always been good, leaving me wanting more.  That was until lastnight.  Maybe it's the state of the economy causing the need to watch their costs because they seem to be cutting back on critical ingredients.  The chicken breast in the parmesana and bianco chicken entrees were pounded to a paper thin thickness.  Also, there were very few small, diced pieces of shrimp in the penne vodka shrimp entree.  This used to be served with medium-sized, whole shrimp.  Next time when Italian food sounds appetizing, this will not be on the list.  It was very disappointing.","0","0","0"

I found toasted ravioli after so long and it was pre-doused in marinara, bah. I wanted a dish that was on the dinner menu, but was told ""the kitchen is too busy tonight, can't do that"" so that was a bummer. The penne al vodka was okay, thus the 2 stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to order from there again.","1","0","0"

Our waiter Michael just happened to be from the same neighborhood as my friends. Instant bonds were made. We had a great time, food was excellent and Michael was just perfect as our server. All the other waiters that stopped by our table for water bread etc were just as friendly. The place has a great family feel to it and without pressure to dine and leave. Will go back for sure!!!","2","0","3"

Very New Yorky feel minus Don Corleone :)  I had their pasta pollo which was delicious!  Drinks...well they are what they are... I'm not a big fan of mixed drinks except maybe a Irish car bomb Ouch!  However, order a drink and sit at the bar.  Bartender Brianna was pretty cool and she'll make you smile.  Sitting area for dinner can get crowded but you get a more intimate feel.  If your date likes pasta...well you know where to go now - good luck!","0","0","0"

My parents were celebrating their 65th wedding anniversary and I booked the small wine cellar room for my family and out of town guests.  The food was exceptional and the service was phenomenal.  We had at least two waiters ensuring that our every need was met.  Everyone had a wonderful evening that will not soon be forgotten.  Thank you, Pasta Brioni!!","0","0","0"

We were mostly impressed. We had good service from arrival to departure. I think we were the only customers when we arrived at 1:25.  The wine list was a disappointment.  My wife was planning on a bottle of an interesting Italian white wine but there was little to choose from.   The red wines offered more but the list was not extensive.  There are a lot of American winesTwo of us had spaghetti and meatballs. It was a good choice. The portion was very large and tasty. I have had sauce I liked better but that is a matter of preference. My wife had pappardelle bolognese. The sauce was meaty and rich and dotted with chunks of fresh mozzarella. Other friend had a chicken sandwich and was happy.  Wife and I  split a portion of flourless Chocolate cake. It was good. Friends split a pumpkin cheesecake and liked it. This is not an inexpensive lunch but the prices were not unreasonably high.","0","0","0"

Only thing I'm trying to figure out is why it took me so long to go back!! I ordered a special dish that they had just added to the menu, Penne Milano. Incredible. We had the homemade cheesecake which was the best I can remember in a very long time. The place has been updated and the ambience was great. I know it won't be 16 years before the next visit!","0","0","0"

Waiter was on his A game. Filling waters, getting orders, everything was great. No complaints. Food: yum! Italian food. Bug portions. Enough to split or take home for leftovers. Hot bread brought after ordering. On the table balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil available. We ordered a Caesar salad to share and I got the penne vodka with chicken. Pasta cooked well. Sauce was balanced. It is very good pasta. I will be returning. Environment/ambiance: very Italian restaurant. Had some TVs at the bar. Dark lighting. Outside was nice. everything was clean. Mixed crowd. More for quiet gatherings or dates. Lots of Frank Sinatra playing. Parking: lot, spacious.","0","0","0"

I had called in advance to inform that I would be bringing in my mother for her 80th birthday. The person I spoke with mentioned that they would have a special table ready for her and a cake. When we arrived, we were instructed to pick our own table; no special preparations.  Had to ask multiple times for the parmesan cheese which, when finally brought out, was in a grinder that kept breaking on the waiter. At the completion of the meal that waiter asked, ""done yet""? How about, ""ma'm are you finished yet""?The olive oil was rancid. For the price of lunch ($74 for two), will not be back.","0","0","0"

The bruschetta appetizer is a favorite and I've never been disappointed in the spaghetti and meatballs. My only gripe is that they don't offer Chicken Vesuvio, which happens to be one of my most favorite Italian dishes. I'd probably visit more frequently if they did. The service is really great. The waiters -- yeah, they're pretty cute -- are friendly, attentive and accomodating. Two thumbs up for Pasta Brioni!","1","0","1"

This evening, the server, Megan, and Chef Michael Siggins outdid themselves. My dr. recently put me on a strict anti-inflammatory diet where all legumes, grains, dairy and nightshades (like tomato and eggplant) are out of the question (which sucks tremendously when dining at a fabulous Italian restaurant). Megan listened to my limitations, made great suggestions, and when she told Chef Siggins about my dilemma, he personally came out to talk to me, and ultimately created a delicious, satisfying dish that was completely in line with what I'm allowed to eat. The level of care Megan and Chef Siggins showed for my dietary limitations and the quality of the scrumptious dish I enjoyed were far and away beyond what I expected. They obviously take a lot of pride in what they do.  Many thanks and kudos!","1","0","1"

Plus their nice warm breads that they bring out to start with are sooooo good! They have these different flavored butters that make them even better! Plus they waiters are all super friendly and very familiar with the menus. During lunch hour they stay on time and I'm always to get in and get out if I'm in a hurry.","1","0","0"

I had heard great things about the food from friends and finally decided to try it for my birthday. We arrived a little after 8 pm on a weeknight and immediately felt like we were intruding. They weren't closing for another hour yet the reception was cold. We sat alone in the main lounge, which was fine. Our waiter was very matter-of-fact and didn't make any attempt at chitchat; again the cold shoulder. The food was tasty and the portions ample but not worth the price, in my opinion.  There's other Italian restaurants I'll try first before coming back.","1","0","0"
